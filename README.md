# Crowdfunding_ETL
The contributors of this Project are Rachel Berer, Matt Viola, Abanoub Malek, Tehreem Uzma, Manjusha Sethi
We performed ETL on category, subcategory, Campaign, Contact files.
We merged the data as required.
Dropped the unnessesary columns.
We converted all the dataframes into Cleaned CSV files. 
We created a table Schema using QuickDBD.
After that imported Schema to Postgres to a database named Crowdfunding_db and created tables: category, subcategory, Campaign, Contact.
Then populated the tables with our corresponding CSV files.
